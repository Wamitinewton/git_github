## What is Git & Github
- `Git` - is a free and open-source distributed version control system used for source code management. It is designed to handle small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git tracks changes in any set of computer files, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.
- `Github` - is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.

## How to start using Git and GitHub
1. [Download here](https://git-scm.com/download) depending on your Operating System
    * Open your terminal and run the command to confirm if Git was successfully installed.
    ```bash
    git version
    ```
2. Create Github acconunt [here](https://github.com/)
3. Connecting your Github account with Git
- Open your terminal 
 * To set your username:
     ```bash
    git config --global user.name "yourUsername"
     ```
    * To confirm your username:
    ```bash
    git config --global user.name
    ```
    * To set your email:
     ```bash
     git config --global user.email "youremail@gmail.com"
     ```
    * To confirm your email:
     ```bash
     git config --global user.email
     ```
4. Creating New repository
* navigate to your project's root directory in your terminal and run:
     ```bash
     git init
     ```

5. Connect the Remote Repository:
* you can connect your repository with local repository through
     ```bash
    git remote add origin your_remote_repository_url
    ```
    Example
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/Wamitinewton/git_github
    ```
    
6. Add Files to the Repository:
* Adding all your changed files to Git repository using the following command:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

7. To double-check that your changes have been added:
*  It will show you a list of the files that have been staged
    ```bash
    git status
    ```

8. Commit the changes to save them to your Git repository:
    * `-m` means message
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    ```
9. To show information about specific commit use
    ```bash
    git show commit_id
    ```
10. To display Commit history, run:
* Note - to exit from command press `q`

    ```bash
    git log
    ```
11. Push Changes to the Remote Repository
* If you have a remote repository, you can push your local changes to it:
    * The `-u` flag creates a tracking reference for the branch, and `origin main` puts the code in the `main` branch.
    * This command is used to push your local changes to the "master" branch 
    ```bash
    git push -u origin master
    ```
 * if you want to push to different branch
    
    ```bash
    git push -u origin your_branch_name
    ```
 * Fetching Updates
    ```powershell
    git fetch
    ```
 * You can also use 
    ```powershell
    git push
    ```

 12. Pull Changes from the Remote Repository:
 * Used to sync with changes made by others in a remote repository:
    * This fetches changes from the remote "master" branch and merges them into your local branch.
        ```powershell
         git pull origin master
        ```
 13. Changing remote Url
       ```powershell
         git remote set-url origin https://new-url.git
       ```
 15. Adding Multiple Urls
    * You can use `--add` to add an additional URL and ``--push`` for pushing. This is helpful if you have read and write access via different URLs.
       ```powershell
       git remote set-url --add --push origin https://new-push-url.git
       ```
 16. Removig remote url
       ```powershell
       git remote set-url --delete origin https://old-url.git
       ```
 17. Changing fetch Url
       ```powershell
       git remote set-url origin https://new-fetch-url.git
       ```
 13. To add README to your project, you can run
       ```powershell
       git add Readme.md 
       ```
### Branching
 1. Creating New Branch
    ```bash
    git branch name_of_your_branch
    ```
 2. Checking list of your branches
    ```bash
    g$it branch
    ```
    ```bash
    git checkout
    ```
 2. Swithching from one branch to another
    ```bash
    git checkout branch_name
    ```
    * available in Git versions 2.23 and later
    ```bash
    git switch branch_name
    ```
    * If the branch you are switching to doesn't exist yet, you can create it at the same time by adding the `-b` and `-c` in switch
    ```bash
    git checkout -b new_branch_name
    ```
    ```bash
    git switch -c new_branch_name
    ```
 3. Deleting a branch
 * make sure you are not in the branch you want to delete
    ```bash
    git branch -d branch_name   
    ```
4. Renaming a branch:

    ```bash
    git branch -m new_branch_name
    ```
5. Merge Branches
* To Merge the specified branch into the current branch.use
    ```bash
    git merge branch_name
    ```
6. Setting Upstream Branch
    * Sets the upstream branch for the current branch to track a remote branch.
    ```bash
    git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/branch_name
    ```
7. Removing Remote URL from the Project
   * Removes the remote origin URL from the project
   * In case you want to stop pushing to a particular repository:
     ```bash
     git remote remove origin
     ```

8. Deleting Contents and Pushing from Another Project
   * Useful if you want to delete a particular codebase and push from another project.
   * Navigate to the project you want to delete from the GitHub repository.
   * **USE WITH CAUTION OR KITAKURAMBA:**
     ```bash
     git rm -rf .
     ```
   * Commit the removal:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "<YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE>"
     ```
   * Push changes to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```
   * At this point, your repo is empty.

9. Pushing New Code
   * Set the upstream branch:
     ```bash
     git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main
     ```
   * Pull the latest changes first:
     ```bash
     git pull origin main --rebase
     ```
   * Push Your Changes
     ```bash
     git push origin main --force
     ```
